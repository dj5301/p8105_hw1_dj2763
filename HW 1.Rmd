# Loading Library
Loading library that going to used in the rest of problems
```{r}
library(moderndive)  
weather_df <- early_january_weather # provide data "early_january_weather" and rename it

library(tidyverse) # dplyr/ggplot2/readr
```

# Problem 1

A: The data are from the moderndive library. After loading the library we want to use, we can load the dataset `r data("early_january_weather")`. 

This dataset contains `r nrow(early_january_weather)` rows and `r ncol(early_january_weather)` columns (358 and 15)

The variable names are `r paste(names(early_january_weather)` (origin, year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib, time_hour, 15 total). 

The mean temperature is about `r mean(early_january_weather[["temp"]], na.rm = TRUE)` about average 39.58˚F.


## Alternative way to get all the information above

```{r}
library(skimr)
skim(weather_df)
```

## Plot

Visualize the time and temperature by scatter plot and save it
```{r}
data("weather_df")
ggplot(weather_df, aes ( x = time_hour ,  y = temp , color = humid )) +
  geom_point(size = 4, alpha = 0.8, stroke = 0.05,) +
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot",
       subtitle = "Temperature(˚F) vs. Time(hours)",
       x = "Temp (˚F)",
       y = "Hour(s)",
       color = "Humid %"
       ) 
ggsave("scatter_plot.png", dpi = 600, path = "~/Desktop/💻/按课程类型分类/P8105 Data Science 1/Homeworks/p8105_hw1")
```

# Problem 2
## 1st Step
Create a dataframe

```{r}
data_df = tibble(
  norm_sample = rnorm(10), # A random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
  
  vec_logical = rnorm(10) > 0, # A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are       greater than 0
  
  vec_char = letters[1:10], # A character vector of length 10
  
  vec_factor = factor(rep(c("Super", "Modest", "Inferior"), length.out = 10)) # A factor vector of length 10, with 3   different factor “levels”
)
```

## Q2: Try to take the mean of each variable in your dataframe. What works and what doesn’t?

Taking the mean of a variable in a dataframe by using the pull function
```{r}
mean(data_df |>  pull(norm_sample)) # Value is working
mean(data_df |>  pull(vec_logical)) # Logical is working
mean(data_df |>  pull(vec_char)) # Character is not working
mean(data_df |>  pull(vec_factor)) # Factor is not working
```
Conclusion: Only numerical value is working with mean and pull function

## Q3: What happens, and why? 

Applying the as.numeric function to the logical, character, and factor variables
```{r}
as.numeric(data_df |>  pull(vec_logical)) # Logical is working
as.numeric(data_df |>  pull(vec_char)) # Character is not working (NA returns)
as.numeric(data_df |>  pull(vec_factor)) # Factor is partially working (return internal encoding)
```
Conclusion:

Logical: 1=TRUE, 0=FALSE.

Character: Reports an error message stating "NAs introduced by coercion" because character values cannot be directly converted to numeric values.

Factor: Returns the internal encoding of the factor (1 and 2), not the actual names of the levels.

## Q3 (continue):Does this help explain what happens when you try to take the mean?

A:Yes, for numeric columns, mean is the regular mean. But for logical columns, R automatically interpret TRUE as 1 and FALSE as 0, so the average is calculated. If the value is more close to 1, the TUREs are more. And for character columns, mean reports an error because it cannot convert to numeric values. Last for factor columns, mean reports an error because factors are categorical and are not automatically converted to coded numeric values.

## Summary

The mean function is only works on numeric and logical data types.Character and factor values it won't automatically converted to numeric values. When we applied the mean function, it will return an error message. The as.numeric function reveals how R handles different data types internally.
